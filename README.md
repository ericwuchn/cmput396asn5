This is an Terran AI player of StarCraft II implemented with Blizzard's sc2client-api in C++. It can win StarCraft II built-in bot with "Harder" difficulty.
The program is inside "main.cpp". To test it run "x64\debug\bot.exe" (you need StarCraft II installed and have the CactusValleyLE map inside the "Maps" folder).
